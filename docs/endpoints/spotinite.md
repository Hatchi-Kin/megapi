# Documentation for `endpoints/spotinite.py`

This module contains the endpoints for what we call, the 'Spotinite service'. It provides routes for using the python spotipy library to interact with the Cyanite API. The Cyanite API is a music recommendation service. It uses the Spotify's ID to identify songs and can recommend songs based on a given artist or band name and a track title.
